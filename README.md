# update 31 july 2025
used better api from newsapi.org, added relevance in articles to use usability heuristics like
1. Visibility of System Status
showing users how well each article matches their query through a visible Rank label.
2. Recognition Rather Than Recall
replacing technical terms like "relevance score" with the simpler, more familiar "Rank", helping users understand without needing prior knowledge.
3. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
By removing technical jargon and using color + label, the UI is more approachable and less cluttered.
